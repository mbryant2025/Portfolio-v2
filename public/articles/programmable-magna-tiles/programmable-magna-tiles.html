    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>This project combines Magna-Tiles and programmable components like 7-segment displays, switches, and sensors.

        The user uses a web interface to program in a block or text fashion. This code then sent to the ESP32 over BLE where it is stored and can be interpreted and executed, bringing projects to life.
        
    </p>


    <h2>Role</h2>

    <p>This project is actively being built for the Duke Product Design course by a 5-person design team. I am responsible for the software for this project. This includes the interpreter, the React App, and their integration.</p>

    <p> More info coming soon! </p>
